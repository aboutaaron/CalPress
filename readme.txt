// Description

CalPress is a theme framework for media, developed my Josh Williams and the
UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. 

CalPress started as a fork of the wonderful Sandbox theme by Andy Skelton and Scott Wallick.

Many ideas come from Ian Stewart's Thematic, another great Sandbox-derived theme:

The base theme and most CalPress child themes run on Nathan Smith's 960 Grid System CSS framework and John Resig's jQuery JS framework.
