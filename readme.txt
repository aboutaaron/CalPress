CalPress is a fork of the wonderful Sandbox theme by Andy Skelton and Scott Wallick.

Many ideas come from Ian Stewart's Thematic, another great Sandbox-derived theme:

The base theme and most CalPress child themes run on Nathan Smith's 960 Grid System CSS framework and John Resig's jQuery JS framework.
